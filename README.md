BitDay-Linux
=============

BitDay-Linux is an automated installer for the [BitDay package](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitday/comments/1ts4j0/bitday_version_10/) by [/u/BloodyMarvellous](http://www.reddit.com/user/BloodyMarvellous).

## Requirements

Requirements are usually built into most Linux distributions:

* **wget** to download the zip
* **tar** to extract the downloaded zip

## How can I help?

* Is your Linux distribution/desktop environment not supported?

Feel free to do your research to find out how to determine if another user is using the same desktop environment, and how to update wallpapers via command-line (bash) on that environment, then feel free to **fork** and **create a pull request** with the desired changes to **update.sh** to include those distros/desktop environments.

* Is there a bug?

Feel free to do the same to fix it.
